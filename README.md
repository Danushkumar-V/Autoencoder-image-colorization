# Autoencoder-image-colorization
The "colorization of grey scale images using autoencoders" project is a machine learning project that involves using unsupervised learning algorithms, specifically autoencoders, to add color to grayscale images. Autoencoders are a type of neural network that can be trained to reconstruct an input by learning to compress and decompress the data.

In this project, the goal would be to use autoencoders to add color to grayscale images in an automated and intelligent way. To do this, a dataset of grayscale and color images would need to be prepared. This dataset would be used to train the autoencoder to learn the relationships between grayscale pixels and their corresponding color pixels.

Once the autoencoder has been trained on this dataset, it can then be used to colorize new grayscale images. The autoencoder would take the grayscale image as input and use its knowledge of the relationships between grayscale and color pixels to generate a color version of the image.

This project could have a variety of applications, such as improving the visual quality of old black and white photos, or adding color to images for artistic or creative purposes. The use of autoencoders allows for a more automated and efficient process for colorization, as compared to manual techniques that require manual selection and coloring of each pixel.
